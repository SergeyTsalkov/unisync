TODO:
  - since windows doesn't support symlinks, find a workaround (test with bestmc repo)
    - symlink=on/off/follow -- on by default, off will skip symlinks
    - give instructions for turning on symlinks in Windows: https://superuser.com/questions/994093/give-an-application-symlink-permissions-within-a-directory-in-windows
  - don't use /tmp as tempdir by default, might be on wrong partition
  - if local and remote watch is off, actually exit client and don't auto-retry
  - if we can't find remote path, explain how to install unisync remotely
  - use start/stop/stopall/status/log to manage background workers
