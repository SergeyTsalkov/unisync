TODO:
  - dump server connection on error, auto reconect and retry
    

  - server command line lets you choose IP/port
  - log messages for server: connected, started syncing, connection lost, etc
    better log messages for invalid cert disconnect
  - server should remove watches when user disconnects
    
  - test on Windows, OpenBSD, etc
  - use start/stop/stopall/status/log to manage background workers
