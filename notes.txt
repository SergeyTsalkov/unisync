rsync --archive --delete --exclude='.git' --exclude='unisync' /Users/sergey/unisync/ sergey@ark:unisync

example:
  unisync ~/localpath user@host:remotepath/
  unisync myhost.json
  unisync -start myhost.json (run in background)
  unisync -stop myhost.json (stop running in background)
  unisync -log myhost.json (show+tail log)
  unisync -stopall
  unisync -status (list jobs running in background)


TODO:
  - on Windows, how do we generate an ssh key if ssh.exe is not installed and they use putty?
    - ssh_key= should support putty *.ppk keys (https://github.com/kayrus/putty)
    - if we don't have ssh or putty installed, maybe generate an rsa key?

  - if we can't find remote path, explain how to install unisync remotely
    
  - dump server connection on error, auto reconect and retry
  - test on Windows, OpenBSD, etc
  - use start/stop/stopall/status/log to manage background workers
