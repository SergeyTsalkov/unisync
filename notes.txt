  username: (required for ssh, ignored for directtls)

example:
  unisync ~/localpath user@host:remotepath/
  unisync myhost.json

  unisync -stop myhost.json (stop running in background)
  unisync -stopall
  unisync -status (list jobs running in background)


TODO:
  - error handling
    - dump server connection on error, auto reconect and retry
    - handle timeouts: on connect (regardless of method); use PING once a minute to catch disconects at any point
    - client should delete any .unisync-tmp files on abrupt exit, including if user hits Ctrl+C
    - n.Errors channel should be monitored during all phases, including initial sync on client


  - nativessh method
  - direct / directtls methods
  - parse all command line options, including working without config file (will have to choose cache name)
  - detect CHMOD and sync
  - use keepalive on every connection method
