rsync --archive --delete --exclude='.git' --exclude='unisync' /Users/sergey/unisync/ sergey@ark:unisync

example:
  unisync ~/localpath user@host:remotepath/
  unisync myhost.json
  unisync -start myhost.json (run in background)
  unisync -stop myhost.json (stop running in background)
  unisync -log myhost.json (show+tail log)
  unisync -stopall
  unisync -status (list jobs running in background)


TODO:
  - watcher.go: use mutex instead of atomic edits, so two simultaneous calls to Send() couldn't slip through
  - progresswriter.go: store percent as double so we can calculate ETA when there's <1% progress
  - talk to Pageant on windows
    https://github.com/kbolino/pageant
    https://github.com/davidmz/go-pageant

  - if we can't find remote path, explain how to install unisync remotely
    
  - dump connection on error, auto reconect and retry (this means client must be able to stop all threads)
  - test on Windows, OpenBSD, etc
  - use start/stop/stopall/status/log to manage background workers
