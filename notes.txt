example:
  unisync ~/localpath user@host:remotepath/
  unisync myhost.json
  unisync -start myhost.json (run in background)
  unisync -stop myhost.json (stop running in background)
  unisync -log myhost.json (show+tail log)
  unisync -stopall
  unisync -status (list jobs running in background)


TODO:
  - since windows doesn't support symlinks, find a workaround (test with bestmc repo); maybe skip symlink or follow it?
  - when comparing local and remote lists, exclude anything matching ignore (in case walking the filesystem went wrong)
  - if local and remote watch is off, actually exit client and don't auto-retry

  - if we can't find remote path, explain how to install unisync remotely  
  
  - test on Windows, OpenBSD, etc
  - use start/stop/stopall/status/log to manage background workers
