  unisync -stopall
  unisync -status (list jobs running in background)


TODO:
  - error handling
    - dump server connection on error, auto reconect and retry
    - handle timeouts: on connect (regardless of method); use PING once a minute to catch disconects at any point
    - client should delete any .unisync-tmp files on abrupt exit, including if user hits Ctrl+C
    - n.Errors channel should be monitored during all phases, including initial sync on client

  - connection methods
    - nativessh method
    - direct / directtls methods
    - use keepalive on every connection method
    
  - test on Windows, OpenBSD, etc
  - use start/stop/stopall/status/log to manage background workers

  - add port= field for all connection methods
