{
  local: /path/to/stuff
  remote: /path/to/stuff
  username: (required for ssh, ignored for directtls)
  host: [ip]
  port: (defaults to 22 for ssh, required for directtls)
  method: ssh | nativessh | directtls
  prefer: local | remote | newer | older (default: newer)
  cache: filename (default: [name].cache)
}

example:
  unisync ~/localpath user@host:remotepath/
  unisync myhost.json
  unisync -start myhost.json (run in background)
  unisync -stop myhost.json (stop running in background)
  unisync -stopall
  unisync -status (list jobs running in background)


TODO:
  - error handling
    - dump server connection on error, auto reconect and retry
    - handle timeouts: on connect (regardless of method); use PING once a minute to catch disconects at any point
    - client should delete any .unisync-tmp files on abrupt exit, including if user hits Ctrl+C
    - n.Errors channel should be monitored during all phases, including initial sync on client

  - connection methods
    - nativessh method
    - direct / directtls methods
    - use keepalive on every connection method
    
  - parse all command line options, including working without config file (will have to choose cache name)
  - test on Windows
  - add tmpdir= and remote_tmpdir= to control which dir is used for temp files (default to ConfigDir())
  - possible ssh options: ConnectTimeout=30, StrictHostKeyChecking=no -- make sure we're not prompting to add host key on first connect (maybe BatchMode covers this?)
